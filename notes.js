  lefty-right still applies
  gotta rename some of these components

  > do any of them fit in a general setting?
  perhaps yes.
  so maybe we should create a layout component form them or something

  the image needs to have the rounded corners
  with a psuedo element under neath it offset

  we need a heading that's blue
  as well as text content

  maybe put everything inside the card and divide them with the underline

/**

  well for this page we need buncha things

  one the headline needs to be fixed. there's too much space beween the lines.

  The other thing is page description needs a uniform style.
  Also I feel like idk, what it's like to build a unified typography system that can expand to multiple page.

  what are the elements anyways?
  line-height
  color
  space between paragraphs
  bold stuff
  maybe h3 or h4 inside a specific context

  The other thing that this page needs is the paper design
  the paper design need to have the max-width and also be going over the fixed image. so maybe a relative unit for that

  After that we gotta show the steps to order medication
  there are 3 steps
  we want them to alternate left and right
  maybe we can have them in the white container

  images can be as is tho. or maybe

  the image can have different colors

  3 circles for 3 different steps

  TODO:

  [] Fix headline spacing
  [] Add a wrapper for rich-text - use that context for applying specific styles
  [] determine the font style, color, spacing, for that, even the headings and links
  [] we need 3 prescription images
  [] we need a layout component that can alternate
  [] we need the headline and text
  [] text should match the text above
